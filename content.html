            <p>Learning C++ programming is a rewarding journey that equips you with a powerful set of skills to develop high-performance software, games, system applications, and much more. However, diving into C++ can seem daunting at first due to its complexity and vast ecosystem. To navigate this journey effectively, having a roadmap can provide direction and clarity. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive roadmap to guide you through learning C++:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Understand the Basics</strong><br>Start with understanding the basics of C++, including its syntax, data types, variables, and operators. Familiarize yourself with concepts like control flow (if-else, loops), functions, and basic I/O operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong><br>C++ is renowned for its support for OOP principles. Dive into classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Mastering OOP concepts is crucial for writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore Standard Template Library (STL)</strong><br>The STL provides a rich collection of data structures (like vectors, lists, maps) and algorithms. Learn how to leverage the STL to write efficient and concise code. Understanding STL is essential for competitive programming and real-world applications.</li>
